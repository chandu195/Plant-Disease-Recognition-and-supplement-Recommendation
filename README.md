# Plant Disease Detection System

This project is a Plant Disease Detection System designed to identify plant diseases using images. It provides detailed information about the disease, its cause, treatment, and growing tips. Additionally, it offers medicine suggestions with direct links to online stores.

## Features:
- **Disease Detection:** Predicts plant diseases using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Detailed Information:** Displays disease cause, treatment, growing tips, and recommended medicines.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive GUI built with Streamlit.
- **Custom Background:** A vibrant green leaf background enhances the interface aesthetics.
- **Image Input Options:** Upload an image or capture a photo for analysis.

## Technologies Used:
1. **Python:** Core programming language.
2. **TensorFlow:** For loading and running the pre-trained model.
3. **Streamlit:** To create a user-friendly GUI.
4. **Pillow:** For image processing.
5. **NumPy:** For handling image data.
6. **JSON:** To store disease-to-class mappings and additional information.
